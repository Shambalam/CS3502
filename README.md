# OsThreading
Class Project for CS 3502 exploring thread synchronization. It uses bank transactions as an example of threads accessing the same resources, using mutex to lock accounts while they are being accessed or changed.


# IPC
The project files for these are stored in their own folders in this repo. Extract both IPCParent and IPCChild into their own project folders.

When trying to run the IPC run IPCParent first and then run IPCChild without ending the IPCParent instance.
